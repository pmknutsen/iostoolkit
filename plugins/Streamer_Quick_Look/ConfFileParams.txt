Available parameters for use in Streamer_Quick_Look configuration files
All variables are fields in the structure T.
Some variables are optional

nPixRes             Pixel resolution (microns)
nCircBufferSize     Circular buffer size (N last frame to keep in memory)
nBaselineFrames     Number of baseline frames
vROI                Region of interest to read from frames [left top width height]
nSkipInitialFrames  Number of initial frames to skip
nFramestep          Step between analysed frames
nDisplaystep        Step between displayed frames
                    If nNumColChans is an even number this number should be
                    t should be an odd number
SandboxCallback     Sandbox function - @YourFunctionName
                    Any Matlab function that you want to execute for each frame.
                    Your function should accept T as its sole input parameter.
nNumColChans        Number of color channels (typically 2)
mColMap             Colormap
                    Different colormap can be used for each color channel (requires R2014B)
nRadIntensityPxBin  Pixel binning during estimation of radial intensity
                    Note: Higher number reduces execution time.
vIgnoreFrames       Frames to ignore (are neither read nor processed)
nAVIFPS             Framerate of saved AVI movie (optional)

** Boolean parameters  (0 = no, 1 = yes) **
bEnableNorm         Enable intensity mask normalization
bView               View frames
bLoad               Load T if .mat file with same name exists on disk
bSave               Save T when last frame is processed
bSaveAVI            Grab figure and save as frames to AVI file (optional)
